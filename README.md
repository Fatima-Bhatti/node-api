# Node Beginner Applciation Programming Interface

This is Fatima Bhatti's first Node Api, in this file, I will review and mention the improvements that she needs to make in the codebase for better development.

### Problems
[ ] Extra indentation inserted after github.com/Fatima-Bhatti/node-api/blob/master/index.js?plain=1#l6 line 6
[ ] Code was not indented properly.
[ ] Sample data array i.e. `courses` could have been in a seperate data file.
[ ] Documentation was not up to standards.
[ ] Routes were not defined.
[ ] Try to implement another model, for example, Many Students can have one course.
[ ] JSDocs should have seperate properties.
